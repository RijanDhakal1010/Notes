- [What are pcalls](https://www.lua.org/pil/8.4.html)
	- "All Lua activities start from a call by the application, usually asking Lua to run a chunk. If there is any error, this call returns an error code and the application can take appropriate actions. In the case of the stand-alone interpreter, its main loop just prints the error message and continues showing the prompt and running the commands."

	- "If you need to handle errors in Lua, you should use the  `pcall`  function (*protected call*) to encapsulate your code."

		- What this really means is that if we want to handle something manually we should use `pcalls`.
		- How does this work?
			- You have a piece of Lua code and want to catch any error raised while running that code.

			- This seems to explain the `require` syntax of lua
