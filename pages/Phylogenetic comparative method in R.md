		- *Phylo object: an important data structure that is used by most phylogenetic R packages to encode a tree.* [[Phylogenetic R packages]]
		- Phylogenetic comparative analysis is to use a phylogenetic tree, frequently combined with phenotype trait data for the species in the tree, to learn something about evolution. [[What is phylogenetic comparative analysis?]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- *Phylogenetic comparative analysis is the general endeavor of using a phylogenetic tree, frequently combined with phenotypic trait data for the species in the tree, to learn something about evolution (Harvey and Pagel 1991; Pennell and Harmon 2013).*
		- The modern field of phylogenetic comparitive anlaysis is relatively young and largely goes back to the work of Felsenstein 1985. [[Phylogenetics]]

			- *Although the modern field of phylogenetic comparative analysis is relatively young (tracing back largely to Felsenstein 1985), phylogenetic comparative methods have diversified in scope, number, and importance in recent decades (reviewed in Harmon 2019).*
		- Phylogenetics is new but has largely grown in scope, number and importance in recent decades. Phylogenetics now encompasses an enormous range of topics. Phylogenetics has also expanded in practical applications as the scopes have grown.

			- *Contemporary phylogenetic comparative methods now encompass an enormous range of topics. For instance, phylogenetic comparative analyses have been employed to measure the relationships between characters while taking the phylogeny into account (Martins and Hansen 1997), to infer the rates of species proliferation and extinction through time (Nee 2006), and to fit sophisticated mathematical models to phylogenies and comparative data in an attempt to explain the diversity of life that we see around us on this planet (Maddison et al. 2007). Comparative methods have also been used to track the spread of diseases (Stadler and Bonhoeffer 2013), to understand contemporary threats to species (Greenberg and Mooers 2017), and to describe the dynamics of evolution over thousands or millions of years (Uyeda et al. 2016). Phylogenetics comparative methods have even been used to study the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that started in 2019 (e.g., Wang et al. 2020; Sjaarda et al. 2021).*

		- R has been an integral part in the development of the Phylogenetic comparative analysis methods.
		  collapsed:: true
			- *Over the past decade, the scientific computing environment R (R Development Core Team 2020) has grown to play a key role in phylogenetic comparative methods. Many developers of PCMs tend to work in R, and many PCM users prefer to conduct their analyses in R. This synergy between users and developers means that R has become an essential tool for scientists interested in employing the comparative method in their research.*
		- This book is designed to be integrated with the packages that the developers maintain. This book is also designed to be integrated with the classes that the authors have taught.
		- The authors suggest the following books:
