- From the research of James Mursell in 1939, it seems that when it comes to the skill of reading most people seem to stop trying to improve after the sixth grade. This is not because there is no need to improve past the sixth grade or because it is somehow hard to improve past the sixth grade. This seems to be because there is no volunteer effort to becoming better at reading. Be it the teacher teaching or the student learning. (Page 11)
